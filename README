PyBilliards is a simple 2D game written in python using pygame

= Introduction =

This project implements a basic 2D billiards game in python using pygame. It was originally written by Prashant Agrawal. Later, Pankaj Pandey joined him and now is an active member of this project.

= Salient Features =

Some of the salient features of the game include:
  * Replay function (immensely useful for debugging purposes, plus, looks cool :P)
  * Slow movement (so that you don't miss your critical shots) 
  * Play/pause features at any time during the play
  * Fancy sounds on collision of balls, when they go to holes and on finishing the game.
  * + much more


= Installation =

Installation of PyBilliards is as simple as any other python package. Just follow the following instructions.

= Install using binaries =

Since PyBilliards is written in pure python, the binaries are themselves the sources. However depending on your wish you can choose to install specific binary package for you platform.
Currently we do not yet provide specific packaged binaries, but expect them soon after a release.
We expect to provide at least a windows installer, and maybe an rpm too.

= Install using sources =

Using source install in python is also pretty easy. Just download the source tarball (wait for a release :) ) and extract it to a convenient directory.

== Requirements ==

On your platform you need to install the latest [http://www.python.org python] version. In addition you also need the [http://www.pygame.org pygame] library.
On linux you can easily install them using your favourite package manager.
On windows you may need to download the installers from their website.

== Installation ==

Once you have python and pygame installed, run the following command from a terminal with administrative privileges

    python setup.py install

If you want a developer installation so that you can also try changing the code yourself and help with the development, then do

    python setup.py develop


= Install from trunk =

This is for those who want the current source (with all the new features and bugs :) ).
The project uses [http://mercurial.selenic.com/ mercurial] DVCS for version control.
You need to install mercurial and then clone the repo using the following command

    hg clone https://pybilliards.googlecode.com/hg/ pybilliards 

Then you may proceed using for normal or development installation using the procedure given in the Installation section
